Curses for luajit.

To build pdcurses.dll get mingw and run "pdcurses_src/win32a/buildx??.bat"

The example will make a non blocking console with features like history, some unfinished autocomplete, and some other unfinished things like handling left and right keys while holding ctrl.

It's unfortunately a bit overwhelming (which I don't think examples should be) so this should be changed later. It was just ported from another project of mine.

There is an extra function added called freeconsole() which will just hide the original console. It only does something on windows.

I've included the source from http://www.projectpluto.com/win32a.htm

There are some tiny modifications made to make it work better with non blocking mode. (mainly just remoinvg Sleep so it would run as fast as it can)
